 The goal of the GlueX experiment is to search for and study hybrid mesons.
 Hybrid mesons, and in particular exotic hybrid mesons, provide the ideal
 laboratory for testing QCD in the confinement regime since these mesons
 explicitly manifest the gluonic degrees of freedom. Photoproduction is
 expected to be particularly effective in producing exotic hybrids but
 there is little data on the photoproduction of light mesons. GlueX will
 use the coherent bremsstrahlung technique to produce a linearly polarized
 photon beam. A solenoid-based hermetic detector will be used to collected
 data on meson production and decays with statistics after the first year of
 running that will exceed the current photoproduction data in hand by several
 orders of magnitude. These data will also be used to study the spectrum of
 conventional mesons, including the poorly understood excited vector mesons
 and strangeonium. In order to reach the ideal photon energy of 9 GeV for
 this mapping of the exotic spectrum, 12 GeV electrons are required.
