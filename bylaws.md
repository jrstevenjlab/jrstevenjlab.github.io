# Bylaws of the GlueX Collaboration

## A Membership (Adopted: November 2, 2009)
Membership to the GlueX Collaboration is granted to individual institutional groups by the Collaboration. Each such group should appoint a group leader who is responsible for interacting with the GlueX management throughout the membership process. The group leader then becomes the point of contact for the collaboration on all issues regarding the contributions of the group to the experiment and is responsible for notifying the GlueX management of changes in the institutional group’s membership (e.g., the addition of postdocs or graduate students). The group has the right at any stage to appoint a new or replacement group leader who is then obligated to ensure that the group’s commitments to the experiment are fulﬁlled.

### A.1 Election of Members
1. The group leader will work initially with the Spokesperson and Hall D Leader to identify areas where the institutional group may contribute.
2. To join the collaboration, the group leader should submit a Letter of Intent (LoI) to the Spokesperson. The letter is expected to outline 
    * the physics interests of the group, 
    * the available resources and manpower, including the anticipated percentage of a full time equivalent person (%FTE) for each contributing member, and 
    * expected responsibilities and contributions to the experiment. 
3. The Collaboration Board and Executive Group will review the LoI, consulting with the group leader as necessary. 
4. The Collaboration Board recommends membership to the Collaboration. 
5. The Collaboration votes on the membership of the institutional group. Two-thirds vote is required for approval. 
6. The group becomes a member. 

### A.2 Removal of Members
There are two ways that an institutional group can be removed from the Collaboration:
1. The group leader notiﬁes the Spokesperson of his or her group’s intent to withdraw from the Collaboration. 
2. An institutional group can be removed by a vote of the Collaboration if the group is determined (i) to have failed to fulﬁll their institutional obligations to the experiment or (ii) to have been inactive for a period of at least two years. 
    * The request for removal is brought before the Collaboration Board by the Spokesperson or Deputy Spokesperson after having concluded either of the two criteria for removal apply. 
    * The Collaboration Board evaluates the request and makes a recommendation for a Collaboration vote on the issue. 
    * The Spokesperson notiﬁes the institutional group leader that the Collaboration Board has recommended a vote on the removal of the group. 
    * The group leader has a minimum of sixty days to respond to the recommendation of the Collaboration Board before the issue moves to the Collaboration for a vote. During this time the Collaboration Board may withdraw its recommendation. 
    * The recommendation is voted on by the Collaboration. Two-thirds vote is required to remove the group from the Collaboration.
