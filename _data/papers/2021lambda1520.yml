  title: Measurement of Spin Density Matrix Elements in $\Lambda(1520)$  Photoproduction at 8.2-8.8 GeV
  abstract: We report on the measurement of spin density matrix elements of the $\Lambda(1520)$ in the photoproduction reaction $\gamma p\rightarrow \Lambda(1520)K^+$, via its subsequent decay to $K^{-}p$.  The measurement was performed as part of the GlueX experimental program in Hall D at Jefferson Lab using a linearly polarized photon beam with $E_\gamma =$ 8.2-8.8 GeV. These are the first such measurements in this photon energy range. Results are presented in bins of momentum transfer squared, $-(t-t_\text{0})$. We compare the results with a Reggeon exchange model and determine that natural exchange amplitudes are dominant in $\Lambda(1520)$ photoproduction.

  caption: The Gottfried-Jackson system used in this analysis. The diagram on top visualizes the t obreakdash-channel production process expected to dominate at GlueX energies with $X$ being the exchange particle. The Gottfried-Jackson system is defined in the rest frame of the $\Lambda(1520)$ (see Eq. [1]). The polarization vector of the incoming beam photon is denoted by $\epsilon$.
