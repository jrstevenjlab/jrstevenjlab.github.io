  title: Measurement of Spin-Density Matrix Elements in $\phi(1020)\to K_S^0K_L^0$ Photoproduction with a Linearly Polarized Photon Beam at $E_\gamma=8.2-8.8$ GeV
  abstract: We measure the spin-density matrix elements (SDMEs) for the photoproduction of $\phi(1020)$ off of a proton and decaying to $K_S^0K_L^0$ using 105 pb$^{-1}$ of data collected with a linearly polarized photon beam using the GlueX experiment. The SDMEs are measured in nine bins of the squared four-momentum transfer $t$ in the range $-t=0.15-1.0$ GeV$^2$, providing the first measurement of their $t$-dependence for photon beam energies $E_\gamma = 8.2-8.8$ GeV. We confirm the dominance of natural-parity exchange, which primarily occurs through Pomeron exchange, in this reaction and put constraints on the contribution of other Regge exchanges. We also find that helicity amplitudes where the helicity of the photon and the $\phi(1020)$ differ by two units are negligible.

  caption: Distributions for selected $\gamma p \to K_S^0 K_L^0 p$ events where the $K_L^0$ is reconstructed as a missing particle, as described in the text, (top) the missing mass, showing a clear $K_L^0$ signal, and (bottom) the $\pi^+\pi^-$ invariant mass, showing a clear $K_S^0\to\pi^+\pi^-$ signal. The distributions for measured distributions (black points) agree well with the simulated ones (blue squares).  The vertical lines show the regions selected for further analysis. The legend shown in the top figure applies to both.

(Bottom) The Mandelstam-$t$ distribution for the events selected in the top panel.  The simulated events (blue squares) assume a constant exponential $t$-slope of $4.4 \mathrm{GeV^{-2}}$, and agree with the measured data (black points) up to $-t\approx1$ GeV$^2$.      The shaded regions indicate the events selected for the SDME analysis.     The legend shown in the top figure applies to both.

  caption: Spin-density matrix elements for $\phi(1020)$ mesons produced by a linearly polarized photon beam in the helicity frame.  Our measured values are represented by the black points, with shaded gray boxes indicating the statistical uncertainties, and the error bars represent the total uncertainties.  The correlated systematic uncertainties described in the text are shown as violet error bands. The measurement by Ballam et al. [13] (SLAC) are given by the green data points.  The horizontal black lines show the expectation for $s$-channel helicity conservation with natural-parity exchange (SCHC + NPE), and the blue dashed lines show the Regge theory-based predictions of Ref. [6].
