  title: Beam Asymmetry $\Sigma$ for the photoproduction of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons at $E_\gamma=8.8$ GeV
  abstract: We report on the measurement of the beam asymmetry $\Sigma$ for the reactions $\vec{\gamma}p\rightarrow p\eta$ and $\vec{\gamma}p \rightarrow p\eta^{\prime}$ from the GlueX experiment, using an 8.2-8.8 GeV linearly polarized tagged photon beam incident on a liquid hydrogen target in Hall D at Jefferson Lab. These measurements are made as a function of momentum transfer $-t$, with significantly higher statistical precision than our earlier $\eta$ measurements, and are the first measurements of $\eta^{\prime}$ in this energy range. We compare the results to theoretical predictions based on $t$-channel quasi-particle exchange. We also compare the ratio of $\Sigma_{\eta}$ to $\Sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}$ to these models, as this ratio is predicted to be sensitive to the amount of $s\bar{s}$ exchange in the production. We find that photoproduction of both $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ is dominated by natural parity exchange with little dependence on $-t$.

  caption: The measured degree of linear polarization for the four diamond orientations is plotted as a function of the photon energy, offset from one another in energy for clarity. Events with energy between 8.2-8.8 GeV are selected, as demarcated by the vertical lines.

  caption: The yields of $\eta$ (a) and $\eta^{\prime}$ (b) events are plotted as a function of $-t$ after all selection cuts are applied. The acceptance functions for $\gamma p\rightarrow\eta p  (p\gamma\gamma)$ and $\gamma p\rightarrow\eta' p  (p\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\gamma\gamma)$, shown as the dashed curves, are determined from Monte Carlo simulation using a Regge model.

  caption: (a) The yields integrated over the full range of $-t$, $Y_{\perp}$ and $Y_{\parallel}$, are shown for the $\eta$ events using one set of orthogonally polarized data, and (b) the yield asymmetry is shown, fitted with a $\chi^2/\mathrm{ndf} = 25.59/28$.
