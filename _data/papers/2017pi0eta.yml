  title: Measurement of the beam asymmetry $\Sigma$ for $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ photoproduction on the proton at $E_\gamma=9$ GeV
  abstract: We report measurements of the photon beam asymmetry $\Sigma$ for the reactions $\vec{\gamma}p\to p\pi^0$ and $\vec{\gamma}p\to p\eta $ from the GlueX experiment using a 9 GeV linearly-polarized, tagged photon beam incident on a liquid hydrogen target in Jefferson Lab's Hall D.  The asymmetries, measured as a function of the proton momentum transfer, possess greater precision than previous $\pi^0$ measurements and are the first $\eta$ measurements in this energy regime.  The results are compared with theoretical predictions based on $t$-channel, quasi-particle exchange and constrain the axial-vector component of the neutral meson production mechanism in these models.

  caption: Candidate event yield as a function of the proton momentum transfer $-t$ for (a) $\vec{\gamma} p \to p\pi^0$ and (b) $\vec{\gamma} p \to p\eta$, without corrections for instrumental acceptance.  The acceptance functions (red dashed), determined from MC simulation, are shown for comparison.

  caption: Beam asymmetry $\Sigma$ for (a) $\vec{\gamma}p\to p\pi^0$ and (b) $\vec{\gamma}p\to p\eta$ (black filled circles).  Uncorrelated systematic errors are indicated by gray bars and combined statistical and systematic uncertainties are given by the black error bars. The previous SLAC results~\cite{Anderson1971} at $\overline{E}_\gamma=$10~GeV (blue open circles) are also shown along with various Regge theory calculations.
