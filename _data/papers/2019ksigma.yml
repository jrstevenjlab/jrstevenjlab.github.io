  title: Measurement of the Photon Beam Asymmetry in $\vec{\gamma} p\to K^+\Sigma^0$ at $E_{\gamma} = 8.5$ GeV
  abstract: We report measurements of the photon beam asymmetry $\Sigma$ for the reaction $\vec{\gamma} p\to K^+\Sigma^0$(1193) using the GlueX spectrometer in Hall D at Jefferson Lab. Data were collected using a linearly polarized photon beam in the energy range of 8.2-8.8 GeV incident on a liquid hydrogen target.  The beam asymmetry $\Sigma$ was measured as a function of the Mandelstam variable $t$, and a single value of $\Sigma$ was extracted for events produced in the $u$-channel. These are the first exclusive measurements of the photon beam asymmetry $\Sigma$ for the reaction in this energy range. For the $t$-channel, the measured beam asymmetry is close to unity over the $t$-range studied, $-t=(0.1-1.4) $(GeV/$c$)$^{2}$, with an average value of $\Sigma$ = 1.00 $\pm$ 0.05. This agrees with theoretical models that describe the reaction via the natural-parity exchange of the $K^{*}$(892) Regge trajectory. A value of $\Sigma$ = 0.41 $\pm $0.09 is obtained for the $u$-channel  integrated up to  $-u=2.0$ (GeV/$c$)$^{2}$.

  caption: Photon beam polarization as a function of beam energy, as measured by the triplet polarimeter, averaged over the four different diamond orientations.  Dashed vertical lines indicate the beam energy range used for this analysis.  Vertical error bars show the statistical uncertainty and inner shaded regions show the systematic uncertainty due to the 1.5\% relative uncertainty from the polarimeter analyzing power.  The polarizations for the individual orientations are presented in Ref. 21.

  caption:  Invariant mass of $p\pi^{-}\gamma$ vs. invariant mass of $p\pi^{-}$ after all cuts. The enhancement in the overlap region corresponds to the $\Lambda^0(1116)$ and $\Sigma^{0}(1193)$.

  caption:  The beam asymmetry $\Sigma$ for $\vec{\gamma} p\to K^+\Sigma^0$ as a function of $-t$. The results from the 0/90 and -45/45 data sets are averaged (solid circles) where horizontal error bars indicate the RMS widths of the $t$ bins and vertical error bars represent statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature.  An additional 2.1\% overall relative polarization uncertainty is not included.  The triangles are previous SLAC results [2] at $E_{\gamma} = 16$ GeV, the  curves show predictions from RPR-2007 [6,7] (solid) and Guidal et al. [5] (dashed) at $E_{\gamma} = 8.5$ GeV.
