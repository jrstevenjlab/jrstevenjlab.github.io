  title: Search for photoproduction of axion-like particles at GlueX
  abstract:  We present a search for axion-like particles, $a$, produced in photon-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of approximately 4 GeV, focusing on the scenario where the $a$-gluon coupling is dominant.  The search uses $a\to\gamma\gamma$ and $a\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ decays, and a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 168 pb$^{-1}$ collected with the \gluex detector. The search for $a\to\gamma\gamma$ decays is performed in the mass range of $180 < m_a < 480$ MeV, while the search for $a\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ decays   explores the $620 < m_a < 720$ MeV region.   No evidence for a signal is found,   and 90% confidence-level exclusion limits are placed on the $a$-gluon coupling strength. These constraints are the most stringent to date over most of the mass ranges considered.

  caption:  Fits to the (top) $\gamma\gamma$ and (bottom) $\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ invariant mass spectra after applying the accidental subtraction used to determine the $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ yields (shown here integrated over $t$). The blue dashed line shows the $\pi^0$ component; the cyan dotted lines show the $\eta$ components; the green dashed-dotted lines show the $\omega$ components; and the magenta dashed-double-dotted line shows the linear (power-law) background for the $\gamma\gamma$ ($\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$) channel. The red solid lines show the sum of all contributions. The residuals account for both the statistical and modeling uncertainties.

  caption:  Signed local significances at each scan mass from (black points) all fits and (red lines) the expected distribution for the (top) $\gamma\gamma$ and (bottom) $\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ channels; if the best-fit signal-yield estimator is negative, the signed significance is negative and vice versa. The error bars account for the correlation between nearest-neighbor fit results, which often produces outliers in pairs due to the $\sigma(m)/2$ step size.

  caption:  Results from (red) this search compared to the (gray) previous bounds [19]  from LEP [51,52], $\phi$ and $\eta'$ decays [31], and the (cyan line) \gluex limits recasted from Ref. [30].  In addition, limits obtained from kaon decays [19,50,53-55] and the $B$-meson lifetime [19,50], which  have $\mathcal{O}(1)$ uncertainties induced by the unknown UV physics, are shown as hashed regions.
